# 🚀 AGiXT v1.8.0 - MINIMAL WORKING VERSION

**GOAL: Get AGiXT working without the bugs from v1.7**

## ❌ What's NOT in v1.8.0 (to avoid bugs):
- ❌ **No EzLocalAI** (was causing token size issues and hangs)
- ❌ **No frontend** (was causing complete freezing)
- ❌ **No complex model setup** (was breaking agent creation)
- ❌ **No proxy/nginx** (was causing connection issues)

## ✅ What IS in v1.8.0 (working foundation):
- ✅ **AGiXT backend only** (port 7437)
- ✅ **SQLite database** (simple, no issues)
- ✅ **Basic agent management** (via API)
- ✅ **Minimal configuration** (no token bugs)
- ✅ **Working foundation** for incremental improvements
